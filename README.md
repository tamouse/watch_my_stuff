# WatchMyStuff

## The Issue

I pressed the "Unwatch All" button on [GitHub](https://github.com)
without thinking too much about it, and suddenly, the world went
quiet.

Going through my personal repos, the organizations I'm part of, and so
on is just a royal P.I.T.A.

I wanted to learn how to use Octokit, as well.

## Installation

No installation instructions. I don't know if I want to provide any.

## Configuration

Obtain a Personal access token with your GitHub user by visiting
<https://github.com/settings/applications>. Set the access for "repo",
"user", "gist", and "notifications".

## Usage

Just the command line:

    $ watch_my_stuff

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that
will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec watch_my_stuff` to use
the code located in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of
this gem.
